# Divi Project

Omg, a lot can go wrong when scraping a website...

## What's left

The original sitesucker files are at: divi-cdn/wb
The processed files are at: divi-cdn/w and e.g. accessible through http://d2zzfs4dhls0ll.cloudfront.net/w/atlas-of-architecture.html

# Scripts

## replacer.py

Used to process the html files... :)

## app...js
The original js with some mods by the master himself

## Caching

Be careful when you reupload a file, since cloudfront caches your stuff. You'll need to make an invalidation
